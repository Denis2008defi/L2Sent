Project L2sent: Solving the Fragmentation Problem of Layer-2 Solutions on Ethereum

1. Introduction

The L2sent project aims to develop a prototype of an innovative tool that will solve the critical problem of fragmentation in the Layer-2 (L2) solutions ecosystem on Ethereum. The project's goal is to create a seamless bridge between various L2 networks, such as Rollups (Optimistic and ZK-Rollups) and State Channels, ensuring efficient and secure transfer of assets and data.

The Ethereum ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and L2 solutions play a key role in scaling the network. However, the current architecture of L2 networks is characterized by isolation, which creates significant obstacles for users and developers.

2. Analysis of Existing Solutions

2.1 Overview of Layer-2 Solutions
Rollups:
Optimistic Rollups: Assume transactions are valid and use fraud-proof mechanisms.
ZK-Rollups: Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs to ensure transaction validity.
State Channels: Allow off-chain transactions, recording only the initial and final states on the main blockchain.
2.2 Compatibility Issues
Different L2 networks use different protocols and data formats, hindering interaction between them.
Transferring assets and data between L2 networks requires complex and often unreliable bridges, leading to delays and increased fees.
Liquidity fragmentation reduces the efficiency of decentralized finance applications (DeFi).
Users have to interact with many different L2 networks, complicating the user experience.
2.3 Existing Solutions for Inter-Network Interaction
Bridges: Allow transferring assets between different blockchains but can be vulnerable to attacks.
Messaging Protocols: Allow transferring data between blockchains but require developing complex protocols.
Atomic Swaps: Allow exchanging assets between blockchains without intermediaries but are limited to certain asset types.
Third-Level Solutions: Aim to unite second-level solutions but are in early development.
3. L2sent Concept

The L2sent project proposes developing a prototype that will create a unified and interconnected L2 solutions ecosystem. Our tool will provide:

Seamless transfer of assets and data between various L2 networks.
A unified interface for interacting with various L2 networks.
Increased liquidity by combining the liquidity of various L2 networks.
Improved security by using advanced cryptographic methods.
4. L2sent Architecture

The L2sent prototype will be developed using a modular architecture, allowing easy integration of various L2 networks. Zero-Knowledge Proofs and inter-network communication protocols are planned for use.

4.1 L2 Network Integration Module:
Responsible for interacting with various L2 networks and their APIs.
Provides data conversion between different L2 network formats.
4.2 ZK-proofs Module:
Generates and verifies Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
Ensures transaction security and confidentiality.
